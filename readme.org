* BaraCuda : a CUDA kernel compositor
/yes, with one C/

baracuda is a POC/WIP of a kernel composition utility, meant to break down
the writing of cuda kernel into smaller pieces and examinate the
rendering result of the combinations in realtime.

[[./screencap.jpg]]

It's written with QT5 and runs with cuda v4 to v7.

** GLSL sauce
A GLSL wrapper is included : with a few modifications, 
a GLSL code will compile. Not all, as the wrapper is fairly incomplete.

Don't expect performances : this does not generate machine code, but
add extra structures, for the standard glsl functions, swizzles 
operations and vectors association/composition to work.


** Build
=$ qmake && make=
note that if you =qmake -project=, this will overwrite =baracuda.pro=

** cuda setup

Check the hardware

=lspci -v | grep -i nvidia=

If your card is registred as a 3D controller,
you'll need either to run [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/bumblebee][bumblebee]],
or tho turn the GPU as primary device in your BIOS.

check the number id and go to [[http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/352.55/README/supportedchips.html][supportedchips]]

For debian : https://wiki.debian.org/NvidiaGraphicsDrivers

Bumblebee project page : https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/bumblebee

For a fresh start on debian :

purge anything related to nvidia and cuda : 
=apt-get purge nvidia-* cuda-*=

install nvidia-driver through the jessie backport :
=apt-get install -t jessie-backports bumblebee-nvidia=

Inspect any errors by digging into =/var/log/Xorg.8.log= and =kern.log=

*** gcc setup
take note that gcc-4.7 and up aren't supported with cuda6
you'll have to install  gcc-4.6 g++-4.6 (or 4.4 with cuda5)

*** troubleshoot
=`CUDA_ERROR_NO_DEVICE (no CUDA-capable devices were detected)`=
=cuInit returned 100=
either you're back to start or you forgot to run baracuda
with =optirun baracuda=

If running the rendering in a virtual framebuffer and that is the case
with optirun -- *libqxcb will crash* when dragging an item from the
list to composer.  For now, the workaround is to add the item when
it's clicked
