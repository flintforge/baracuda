CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT 	
This most frequently indicates that there is no context bound to the current thread. 
his can also be returned if the context passed to an API call is not a valid handle 
(such as a context that has had cuCtxDestroy() invoked on it). 

This can also be returned if a user mixes different API versions (i.e. 3010 context with 3020 API calls). 
See cuCtxGetApiVersion() for more details.
